# Exercise: Create a variable, b, that points to the base of a rectangle with a
# value of 10.  Create a variable, h, that points to the height of a rectangle
# with a value of 2.  Calculate the perimeter.  Change the base to 6 and
# calculate the perimeter again.

b = 10
h = 2
perimeter = (b + h) * 2  
print("The perimeter of a rectangle with b = 10 and h = 2 is", perimeter)

b = 6
perimeter = (b + h) * 2  
print("The perimeter of a rectangle with b = 6 and h = 2 is", perimeter)
